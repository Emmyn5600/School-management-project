## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:


## Built With

* Ruby v3.0.0
* Ruby on Rails v7.0.4
* Postgres: >=13.4-1
* SQLite3
* Node.js v16.10.0
* Yarn v1.22.18


### Setup and Install

* Open your terminal - Windows: `Win + R`, then type `cmd` | Mac: `Command + space`, then type `Terminal`
* Navigate to a directory of your choosing using the `cd` command
* Run this command in your OS terminal: `https://github.com/Emmyn5600/School-management-project.git` to get a copy of the project
* Navigate to the project's directory using the `cd` command
* Install dependencies by running `bundle install`
* Migrate the database to your environment by running `rails db:create` then `rails db:migrate`
* Run `rails webpacker:install` to configure Webpacker for your environment. Otherwise, an error like `Webpacker::Manifest::MissingEntryError` will appear if you attempt to run the server.
* Execute `rails server` to fire up the server
* Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to get into the app
* Interact with the app
* To close the server, enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal

### Setup

Instal gems with:

```
bundle install

yarn install
```

Setup database with:

```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
```

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.

### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Run tests

```
    bundle exec rspec
```
